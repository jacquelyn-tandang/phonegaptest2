<p>Depending on what you do when you visit any web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site's owners. This includes www.sarai.ph</p>

<p>We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit or supply information to any web site, we think it's a good idea for you to first understand what that site's privacy policies are. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that except as specifically noted, we do not use your personal information for any other purpose. We never sell or share your information with any third party. For specific information on privacy issues, please see below. </p>

<h4>Newsletter Registration or Requests for Information</h4>

<p>We only collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using or registering with us. "Personal information" includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name or email address. While you can browse our site without registering, you will need to sign in using your Facebook account in order to take advantage of certain features such as sharing information, adding comments and sending reports.</p>

<h4>Browsing and the Use of Cookies</h4>

<p>We may use cookie technology as part of our web site's statistical reporting. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience and to gather web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the internet provider's domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before, and after, coming to our site. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "click stream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page.) Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you. </p>

<p>We also use standard web server log files to help us count visitors and evaluate our site's technical capacity. We use this information to find out how many people visit our site, help us arrange the pages in the most user-friendly way, keep the site browser-friendly, and to make our pages more useful to our visitors. We record information on site traffic but not information on individual visitors to our site, so no information about you in particular will be kept or used. </p>

</p>To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) </p>

<h4>Email, Mailing Lists and Other Services</h4>

<p>When you send us an email, we use your email address to thank you for your comment and/or reply to your question, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. Beyond our initial reply, we will never use your email address to send you any unsolicited message or information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use. </p>

<h4>Linking to Other Sites</h4>

<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from www.sarai.ph to another web site, the www.sarai.ph Site Rules and this Privacy Policy are no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including any site that has a link on our site, is subject to the rules and policies of that site. We encourage you to read the rules and policies of the sites you visit to further understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. </p>

<h4>Our Policy Regarding Sharing of Information</h4>

<p>Our policy is simple: we never sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances. </p>

<h4>How You Can Decide What Communication You’ll Receive from Us</h4>

<p>If you choose to receive them using your application settings and we may periodically send you email messages describing updates, new features, or promotional offers related to this web site. You can choose to stop receiving this email at any time. Simply follow the instructions included in your email, or send a reply stating your request. </p>

<p>If you do not explicitly choose to receive informational emails, the only email messages you will receive from us will be to respond to email inquiries that you send us. </p>

<h4>How We Protect the Security of Your Information</h4>

<p>The security of your personal information is very important to us and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. www.sarai.ph uses security measures in place at its physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our web site. </p>

<h4>Changes to the www.sarai.ph Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>This Privacy Policy was posted in July 2016. We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this policy at any time. You are responsible for revisiting this page to review our privacy policy updates. </p>

<h4>How to Contact www.classicsleepcare.com</h4>
